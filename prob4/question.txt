a) Write a page “MiniAdd.jsp” that carries out simple additions of two numbers. The JSP
should:
1. present a form where the user can specify two numbers,
2. contain a submit button that posts back to the same page (i.e. “miniadd.jsp”),
3. show the result of the requested addition, and also
4. show the sum of all the additions carried out by the user so far.
