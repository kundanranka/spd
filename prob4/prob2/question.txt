Exercise 2- Address Management Application
WriteaJSP based web application for address management, which allows to register and delete
entries and to search for entries based on partial information given.
a) Create the table "addresses" in the test database withastructure as follows

b) WriteaJSP “Register.jsp", which providesaform to insertanew entry foraperson into the
table, and another JSP “exRegister.jsp", which actually performs the required INSERT
statement. UseaJavaBean “AddressBean" to check the validity ofarecord before inserting it
into the database, i.e. check that at leastaforename is given (a surname might not always be
accessible to you in the case of persons known only by their nickname), and also either the
number ofastationary oramobile phone or an e-mail address was specified. In case of invalid
information, redirect the request to "Register.jsp" and make sure that the user does not have to
enter valid parts of the record again. Use the "AddressBean" bean to annotate those fields in the
registration form, which caused the insertion of the record to fail, withareasonable error
message. Ifanew record was successfully added to the table using “Register.jsp", redirect the
request to the page “DeleteAddress.jsp", which you are going to write in the next subtask.

c) Add JSPS "DeleteAddress.jsp" and "exDelete.jsp". The JSP "DeleteAddress.jsp" presentsa
list of all entries each followed bya“Delete" button. The "Delete" button is linked to
"exDelete.jsp", which carries out the deletion in the database table. Take care not to exchange
more information than required between "DeleteAddress.jsp" and "exDelete.jsp".

d) Ifanew record was successfully added to the table using "Register,jsp", redirect the
request toapage "SearchAddress.jsp". This page offers another form where the user can specify
partial information concerning arbitrary fields the records in the "addresses" table contain. Carry
out the SELECT statement corresponding to the information given in "SearchAddress.jsp" ina
JSP “exSearchAddress.jsp" and display the result in
"SearchAddressResult.jsp". For selection of an address, combine the fields that specify the
search in the way that seems suitable for you.
