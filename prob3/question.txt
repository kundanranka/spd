Exercise 3 – Responding to a User Request
Write a WEB application comprising of two parts. The page “CollectUserInput” provides
three fields which enable the user to specify input for a random number experiment: the
number of trials Ntrial, the minimum random number Nmin, and the maximum random
number Nmax. By clicking the “Submit” button, the
“EvaluateRandomNumberExperiment” page is requested. This WEB presents these
numbers, performs an experiment where NTrial random numbers between Nmin and Nmax
are drawn and lists the relative frequencies (how often this number was drawn in
percent) for all the numbers between Nmin and Nmax.
