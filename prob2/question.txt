a) Write a WEB page, which presents 75 random integer numbers from {0,1, …, 10} in a
table with 5 columns and 28 rows as follows: the random numbers are listed in the first
three columns, with the sum and the average of the random numbers of a particular row
given in the last two columns. Headers for the five columns (“Trial 1”, “Trial 2”, “Trial 3”,
“Horizontal Sum”, “Horizontal Average”) are printed in the upper row. Finally, the sum
and average of the three columns are printed in the last two rows and the according
headers (“Vertical Sum”, and “Vertical Average”) are given in fourth column.
Try to make the table easy to read by, for example, limiting the number of displayed
digits, using bold fonts, choosing appropriate font and background colors.
b) Modify the created in exercise 2a) so that the random numbers only change on a
new session
HINT: on a new session, initialize Random() with the current time and save time; on an
existing session, initialize Random() with time saved previously in the session scope.
