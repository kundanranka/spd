a) Write a simple Web page that prints out a series of consecutive numbers by using a
Java loop construction. The output could be for example:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
b) Modify your first Web page (1a) such that it prints out the series of numbers given
below using a Java loop:
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100
c) Modify the web page further such that it prints in each line the sum of the squared
numbers iterated through so far, as shown below:
12 = 1
12 + 22 = 1 + 4 = 5
12 + 22 + 32 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14
... and so on
d) In order to make the list printed out by the previous web page easier to read, change
the font color every other line.
